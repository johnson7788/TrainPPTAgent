In the initially published version of the manuscript, survival evaluation of the tLHP signature  in the Javelin101 cohort (Fig.  3e , Extended Data Fig.  6q ) was performed using the general convention with regards to survival analysis, i.e., considering censoring status of 1 as presence  of a clinical event. In the publicly available data of the Javelin 101 trial, however, events were  atypically coded as 0. The updated versions of the figures now properly reflect this different  choice of the original authors. Specifically, the corrected figure sub-panels include the correlation of tLHP signature levels with progression-free survival (PFS) in the avelumab-axitinib  arm (Fig.  3e ), correlation of tLHP signature levels with PFS in the sunitinib arm (Extended Data  Fig.  6q ), level of tumor mutational burden (TMB) with respect to tLHP signature sub-groups  (Extended Data Fig.  7e ), and association of different mutation statuses with the tLHP signature  sub-groups (Extended Data Fig.  7h ). The validation of our findings on the JAVELIN data as well  as the overall conclusions of the manuscript are not affected by this update. The original and  corrected figures can be seen in the Supplementary information.
